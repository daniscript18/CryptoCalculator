# Crypto Calculator
This GitHub project is a calculator to help you calculate your cryptocurrency and dollar earnings on an hourly or daily timeline. It's made with JavaScript and HTML for the user interface, with additional code for Python hobbyists.

To use it you just need to open the `.html` file or run the `.py` file with Python, then answer the questions and it will instantly give you your results.

I will be improving the calculator and adding functions, if you think it would be good to add another function to the calculator or you find any problem, do not forget to notify me, also, maybe I could write the calculator in other languages.
